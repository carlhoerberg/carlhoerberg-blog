    ## Education

    ** Master in Information Technology **  
    2005-2010 at Link&ouml;pings University, Sweden  
    With focus on software development

    ## Experience

    ** [Mon 7 Consulting AB][1] **  
    *From feb 2008 while studying, at full time since jan 2010*  

    Mon 7 Consulting develops customer specific business applications. I've been the lead developer and been responsible for all of our projects, from pre-study, requirement gathering, architecture, development, testing, training, support and server configuration/management. I've been in charge of four other developers. Example of systems we have developed:

    *   Complete business application for veterinary clinics. It handles everything from appointments, journals and prescriptions to accounting and inventory management. Biggest challanges: 
        *    The HA requirements. I built a multi site availablity system.
        *    Integration with on-site resources such as printers, x-ray and lab equipment.
    *   System for insurances management and incident reporting for one of Sweden's largest counties. 
    *   Application for systematic fire precaution work, including a mobile web interface. 
    *   A system for collection of energy statistics, and making a lot of computation and charts over it. Biggest challenge: Scaling for the amount of data which is gathered. Integration with a lot of different statistics providers. 
    *   Administration application for a big electricity broker. Biggest challenge: A manageable, extendable and testable billing routine, which is in almost constant change. 

    All the systems has a web interface and the main development platform is .NET. 

    **[CT Labs][2]**

    **[Centercom AB][4]**

    Centercom provides technical services in web development and web content management. I worked as a developer (C#, XSLT, CSS, HTML, JavaScript) but also with requirement gathering and customer training. They have begged me to come back ever since I quit. 

    **[Ericsson][5]**  
    *Summer job in 2006 and 2007*  
    At the NetSIM department was a mobile network simulator developed. I worked with stuff like implementing functionality in the simulator (Erlang), installation scripts (bash/sh), GUI for the frontend (Java). My supervisor was stunned when the work they had planed for my 5 week period was done within the first week.
